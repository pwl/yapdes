 *
 * @brief Base structure for triggers is defined (ODE_trigger), along
 * with accessory functions. There is a lot of potential for
 * aggressive expansion here.
 *
 * Graph below represents the states (ODE_trigger_state) of an
 * ODE_trigger (states uninitialized and free are not states
 * formally). Each arrow represents a function which changes a state
 * of the trigger (prefixes "ODE_trigger_" and "TRIGGER_" were omitted
 * for clarity). After assigning an ERROR state to a trigger all the
 * functions consider it as broken @b beyond @b repair and as such the
 * state ERROR can be considered as an final-state for a trigger.
