 * Datatype and functions concerning a single module. The relation of
 * ODE_module to ODE_trigger is analoguos to the relation of
 * ODE_solver to ODE_module. Each ODE_module contains
 * ODE_trigger_bundle which is a structure containing all the
 * triggers. The ODE_trigger_bundle has a set of fucntions to access
 * triggers in a feasible manner. Each trigger added to a module can
 * see its ODE_trigger_bundle only by refering to an ODE_module first.
 *
 * Graph below represents the states (ODE_module_state) of ODE_module
 * (states uninitialized and free are not states formally). Each arrow
 * represents a function which changes a state of the module (the
 * prefixes @v "ODE_module_" and @v "MODULE_" were omitted for
 * clarity). After assigning an @v ERROR state to a module all the
 * functions consider it as broken @b beyond @b repair and as such the
 * state ERROR can be considered as an final-state for a trigger. At
 * this moment a broken modules are not completely ignored by all the
 * functions as they may contain working triggers, and singals such @v
 * stop, @v start and @v free can be send to them.
 *
 *
 * @todo Consider adding an additional state in which module is broken
 * but triggers are fine.
