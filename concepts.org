* Interesting libraries
** Memory management
   - malloc_hook
   - allocating a multidimensional table in a single line
     
     int (*x)[10] = malloc(10 * 10 * sizeof(int));
     x[2][3] = 3;

     problem encountered: using __BASE_FILE__ instead of __FILE__
     should solve the issue but due to a bug in gcc it does not
     work. Another problem is that __BASE_FILE__ is gcc specific.
